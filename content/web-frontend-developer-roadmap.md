# A Job-Oriented Learning Path to Become a Web Frontend Developer

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap to become a skilled web frontend developer in the real world. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate frontend developer, these steps will serve as checklists for navigating your journey, ensuring you're well-prepared for the demands of today's job market. Keep in mind that they are interrelated despite the order and can be learned simultaneously.

## Foundations

### 1. Understand the Fundamentals of the Internet and the Web

Creating and deploying the website from A to Z involves various fields, which are divided into jobs. Web frontend developers are responsible to translate the design into code that the browsers of our computer understand. The fundamentals guide you to know the website creation processes and factors in a bigger picture, so that you understand more some decisions later on, and the logic behind the internet and the web. Our learning path provides some insights already about them.

### 2. Explore the Key Actors Involved in the Website

Websites are designed to meet the needs of the end-users. But not only that, we should also look after the employees' experience as well. There are people who work to maintain the content within it such as the copywriters, webmasters, administrator and more. You should be basically familiar with their jobs, so that you can communicate how they interact with it. This anticipates the features that are supposed for the users, the administrator and other different roles.

### 3. Learn About Website Life Cycles

We won't create the website instinctly, it needs conception and purpose in the first place. After that, you are in development with the help of several tools to make your code prettier or follow some formatting rules. The product traverse through different operational history starting from the conception to  production. Also, we can maintain the website to update it, or sometimes we migrate it. The life cycles such as we described above increase the understanding of the requirements and milestones for each phase.

### 4. Explore Different Types of Websites

You will encounter various projects including simple, and complex ones. We can categorize them by their purpose: a portfolio, an e-commerce, a social media, and more. Additionally, websites differ in their nature, a traditional website performs a hard refresh for each internal link transition, however a Single Page Applications provides a smoother user experience. The progressive Web App however acts in between a web application and a native application which should work offline for the users' device.

## Technical tools 

### 5. Master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

After discovering the foundations, you'll spend most of your time on the following web development languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You learn them overtime, and move on to another step when you reach the basic. It means you have to learn something else simultaneously with them since they are the core languages to code for attaining the final output, even you find some frameworks that are mostly based on them. HTML marks the content in the website like this is a link, or a navigation. CSS styles it in order to have the fancy layouts and components. JavaScript in the other hand makes it dynamic, for example, an user clicks a button to perform a calculation. And even as you progress, we put the HTML and the CSS in the JavaScript that most frameworks proceed.

### 6. Understand Microservices and Request Handling

The web frontend developers create the user interfaces, their work also interact with the backend systems through microservices such as REST API, GraphQL, and SOAP to retrieve data for user interfaces. For example, you navigate to a job list in a website, they are actually stored in a database that the backend send them for us. We can request the operations like creating, updating, reading, and deleting an item known as CRUD. Mainly, we send the requests and handle with the responses.

### 7. Learn Version System Control and project management tools

You can learn the Version System Control as soon as you practice coding. It monitor the history of your project, and allows team work together in the code simultaneously. Git is popular, however some people still use SVN. And the code will be paired with hosting platforms like Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket. In the other hand, project management tools serves to assign tasks, and enable team to see the progress of the project. They structure the development phase, and refers their state in the real moment like in progress, in review, or finished.

### 8. Master Website Deployment

While you can develop your project locally, deploying it to a live server is essential for internet access. Familiarize yourself with the deployment process and consider factors that impact successful deployment.

### 9. Choose your Preferred Frameworks and Libraries

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are fundamental, but web development can be time-consuming, and repetitive. Frameworks and libraries, developers speed up development. And in today's jobs, people tend to use them much instead writing things from scratch: React, Angular, Vue an more. There are also frameworks such as Bootstrap, Material UI and Chakra UI to create UI components in your project. And finally, pre-processor and utility classes like Sass and Tailwind CSS gain popularity to simplify CSS development.

### 10. Learn Package Managers, Build Tools and Containerization (e.g: Docker )

Developers create libraries and frameworks to facilitate the development. Package managers help you install them in your project, we have npm, yarn and pnpm that contains thousands of packages for JavaScript including build and development tools. The development ones are not necessary for the final output, they make your code pretty, easy to debug and even set rules for enabling your team follow your development styles to be consistent. The build tools however transform your codes into optimized one for your production such as minimizing, bundling and transpilation. Finally, team may use different environment and operating systems, containerization tool like Docker can help to install your team chosen application tools at once, so that everyone don't struggle to find the right version and application for each operating systems.

### 11. Embrace Best Practices and Architectural Organization

When you start learning to code, any resources can direct you gradually to those best practices and organization. Although, you have to do it consciously for yourself and your team since it will guarantee the maintainability and the readability of your code. There are popular architectures that company usually follow, but also the team has their own decisions on the rules to follow to be consistent.

## Advanced: increase the website quality

### 12. Explore Web APIs

The browsers offer a range of Web APIs that grant access to various functionalities, such as caching data, sending backend requests, utilizing geolocation, accessing the device's camera and more. APIs enables you to tackle specific challenges, like implementing real-time chat and video conferencing. However, remember to prioritize security and user permissions when working with these APIs.
For example, you need to ask permission before using their geolocalization position for their benefits.

### 13. Learn TypeScript

Imagine you have an internal functionality known as function that converts the temperature from the unit degree Celcius °C into Fahrenheit °F, the input should be a number, but JavaScript is a loosy-typed language meaning it lets you and other developers use other types such as text instead of a number. You will later encounter errors because you use text. It's a simple illustration, but as a project evolves, you don't even remember those types. TypeScript helps you spot those errors earlier because you can define the type in advance.

### 14. Dive into Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)

When you code, you check your project manually in your browser if it produces the outputs you want. It includes in the testing, but we want to point out here especially about the automatic ones meaning that we program it as well. The manual way can be quick, but along with the time it may provide many inter-dependent errors that takes long time to spot and correct. From them arises another principle called Test Driven Development to avoid stagnated errors as much as possible. It goes through the three processes: write automatic test before coding, then pass your code with the test, finally refactor it to obtain a better version. Following those steps for each bit of functionality of your code contribute to what's called unit testing. Here are three of the most popular testing libraries: jest, mocha and jest; learning Test Driven Development increase the quality of your website.

### 15. Learn Web Accessibility

Web accessibility enables everyone in different contexts to access the content of the website easily. Imagine someone with sight problem try to navigate to your page, they equip themselves an application known as screen reader that read your writing for them. We as a developer should understand the best practice for matching with those tools. The accessibility is not only for people with disability, but it refers to each one of us in variety of circumstances: users with keyboard only, sight users, design accessibility and much more.

### 16. Prioritize Web Performance and Security

A website should follow some standards practice in order to protect the users, and the owner of the website itself. There are different attacks that hackers could harm the users of the website that we should be aware of even if we are not cybersecurity specialist. Same for the web performance, it affects directly the user experiences, and the traffics for the website. Developers can optimize the performance as much as possible in different ways. Tutorials and documentation might teach you to code that includes some of them, but you have to know them consciously about them later as well.

### 17. Explore Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines

Companies seek ways to accelerate development and deployment processes. Instead of deploying it for each time you update the website, pipelines are there to make it automatic using the Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment processes, so that we always have the latest project version with minimal efforts.

## Bonus: Stay Updated and Adapt

This guide is not complete without this final remark because the technology is always evolving, and companies adapt to new trends. To excel in your field, stay updated with the latest technologies and practices. Additionaly, company has their own workflow and principles to work with their clients, but some popular practice includes agile and scrum methodology which consist of iterative progress, flexibility and customer feedbacks.

By following this job-oriented learning path, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the challenges of becoming a successful web frontend developer in today's dynamic industry.
