        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>I'm Nasandratra Harivonjy, but you can call me Nas. I've been immersed in web development for five years, specializing in JavaScript. My favorite tech stack includes React with Node. There was a time when I lacked patience and focus, experimenting with several popular programming languages. I dreamt of being admired if I could master them all, but those are common mistakes beginners need to overcome gradually.</p>

        <p>If I were to advise someone embarking on this journey, I'd recommend focusing on one thing at a time and ensuring you complete at least 70% of a topic before moving on. I'm mostly self-taught, but recently, I decided to complement my skills by studying online to earn a Bachelor's Degree from Brigham Young University Idaho, which should be completed soon. However, self-education is key because it enables you to stay updated with your chosen languages and engage with the community.</p>
